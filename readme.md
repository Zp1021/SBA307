This project uses a combination of HTML and external CSS to create a website with 4 pages

The the drop down navigation bar code was made following a model from: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_dropdown_navbar.asp
the table code was modeled after: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp

The code presented in index.html presents a page with a brown color complimented by beige/wheat color.
A navbar with a dropdown option on the Forms allows users to pick which page they want to visit.

Clicking on the FAQ option brings us to the FAQ page
This page also has a navbar at the top that works almost identical to the first one.
Below it is a table of random questions that are posted on the left side of the table,
and answered on the rightside of the table.
Below the whole table exists a form space for potential users to ask questions.
To mimic something akin to a real site a button was added that will change colors
to ensure users will see that they will have pressed the button if they submitted an entry.

Hovering the dropdown option and picking login goes to the login form.
From there users will see a form that mimics similar ones from other websites.
Users would be able to input a username and a password and submit it in order to be granted
access to the site. The nav bar in this examples switches to the bottom position to maintain a better
look. There are also no other options besides revisting the FAQ or Home page, thus leaving no need
for a dropdown option in the nav bar. Additionally, there is a hyperlink that redirects the user to a
page that would handle registrations to the site.

As the scope of this project was only 3 pages, the 4th pages purpose was to show off some CSS animations
such as a color change and rotation of the apology statement. Since the background color is beige
the brown color was selected to fill in the box as a contrast keeping the color scheme of the entire site
consistent. Another facete of this statement is that it rotates 360 degrees over the course of 4000 miliseconds
which is delayed a start time by 1 second. Below the statement is a link that allows the user to return from the unfinished page
back to the home page.
